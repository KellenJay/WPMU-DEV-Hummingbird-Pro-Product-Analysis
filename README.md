# Hummingbird Pro – Guided Performance Modes MVP

## Overview
This repository contains the product design, research, and launch plan for the proposed **Guided Performance Modes** feature in WPMU DEV’s Hummingbird Pro plugin.  
The goal is to **reduce onboarding friction**, improve **site performance outcomes**, and create **clear upgrade pathways** for free-tier users.

## Problem Statement
User feedback revealed three persistent pain points:
1. **Setup abandonment** due to complexity and unclear configuration steps.
2. **Performance breakage** from applying incorrect settings without guidance.
3. **Limited visibility** into the impact of changes, leading to dissatisfaction and rollbacks.

## Proposed Solution
Introduce **Performance Modes**—Safe, Balanced, and Power—each **tailored to site type and traffic profile**, with:
- Guided site type selection.
- Clear mode descriptions and short video walkthroughs.
- One-click manual adjustments and rollbacks.
- Real-time performance feedback post-setup.

## Key Metrics for Success
- **Mode adoption rate** (percentage of users completing setup).
- **Average PageSpeed improvement** after mode application.
- **Rollback rate** (indicator of dissatisfaction).
- **Conversion uplift** from free-tier to Pro.

## Launch Plan
- **Phase 1**: Beta to select Pro users → Collect feedback.
- **Phase 2**: Full Pro rollout → Marketing push.
- **Phase 3**: Lite Mode for free-tier → Upsell to Pro.

## Deliverables in this Repo
- **UX/UI Wireframes & Prototype** – Mode selection flow and dashboard layout.
- **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria** – For dev team implementation.
- **Competitor Analysis** – Positioning against key WordPress optimization tools.
- **Phased Launch Plan & Metrics** – Structured GTM approach.
- **Executive Summary** – High-level overview for stakeholders.
